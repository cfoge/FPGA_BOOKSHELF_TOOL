# FPGA_BOOKSHELF_TOOL
A Python Script for anilising and comparing Bookshelf format FPGA designs

bookshelf_analyzer.py gives you statisitics on a bookshelf format fpga design, it reports things like utilisation %
number of nodes, nets ect...

scl_visualizer.py generates a png image from a .scl file to visualise the architecture of the fpga (note this is a bit slow on any actual FPGA)
